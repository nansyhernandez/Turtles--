Recently this year, I found out that I have a sister. She was born after me and was adopted 22 years ago. My mother lost contact to the adoption agency because they closed down and she was unable to contact them again. My sister had been searching for my family and I since she was 8 years old. She recently took a DNA test that showed her that she had a half sibling which was my brother who also took the same DNA test a year prior. That was the start to a whole new beginning. We all now feel complete. She has now met my entire family and everyone was filled with joy and excitement. We are now working on learning more about each other and one thing I know so far is that she has my exact personality.
